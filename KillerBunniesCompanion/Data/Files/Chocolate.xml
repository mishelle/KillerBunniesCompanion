The top one is called an Arrow and the bottom one is called a Kite. Please note that both Arrows and Kites are lit in one of six different colors: Violet, Orange, Green, Yellow, Blue or Red. All cards may be played individually as traditional Killer Bunnies® cards. However, when played in combination, Psi cards have some interesting characteristics:

Non-Matching Colors: If a player has any Arrow and any Kite Psi card (either saved or in his five-card hand), then he may stop play between any two players’ turns, show his opponents his Psi cards, and use one or both of the Psi cards in play. Any Psi cards that are in the Bottom Run or Top Run positions may not be used in this way.

Matching Colors: If a player has an Arrow and a Kite Psi card with matching colors (either saved or in his five-card hand), then he may again stop play between any two players’ turns. This time, however, the player may move all of the bunnies (or half color bunnies) in The Bunny Circle that match the color of the Arrow and Kite to any player that he wishes. For example, the Blue Arrow and Blue Kite Psi cards may be used by a player to move all Blue (and half Blue) bunnies in The Bunny Circle. The player must discard both Psi cards without using them further. Once again, any Psi cards that are in the Bottom Run or Top Run positions may not be used in this way.

If a player uses a Psi card out of his hand (either in a Non-Matching Colors or Matching Colors play), then he must immediately draw a new card or cards from the Draw Pile.</description></topic><topic type=""><title>Bunny’s Eleven</title><description>Bunny’s Eleven may be used once by a player to steal the winnings of any opponent who is successful at either the Carrot Top Casino or Carrot Top Royale. A roll of 7 or 11 on the Green 12-sided die doubles the player’s winnings. May be used at any time!</description></topic><topic type=""><title>The Djarnak</title><description>The Djarnak may be placed between any two adjacent players and prevents them from using any Aggressive cards against each other.</description></topic><topic type=""><title> Go With The Flo</title><description>Go With The Flo may be used once by a player to exchange any saved Special or Very Special card with any opponent for Carrot #4 (Flo).</description></topic><topic type=""><title>The Conch</title><description>The Conch may be used once by a player to silence all opponents for two full rounds of play. Only the player holding The Conch may speak and therefore make deals or exchanges of any kind with other players. A player who speaks must return a Carrot to Kaballa’s Market (even if the market is closed), discard a saved Zodiac card or a saved Mysterious Place card for every word that is spoken during the two rounds of silence. Players without objects will forfeit turns of play.</description></topic><topic type=""><title>Semi-Super Specialty (Lord Of The Bunnies)</title><description>Players with this bunny in The Bunny Circle may play two cards per turn. All Specialty bunnies in The Bunny Circle are eliminated. Unlike Super bunnies, the player who owns this card may not roll the Clear 20-sided die for weapons with levels 1-12.

A Specialty Bunny that has The Heavenly Halo is not eliminated from The Bunny Circle. If The Heavenly Halo is placed on the Semi-Super Specialty bunny, then all Specialty bunnies arriving in The Bunny Circle are safe (not discarded). Semi-Super Specialty cannot be bought back from Weil’s Pawn Shop.</description></topic><topic type=""><title>Celebrity Bunny (Number Six)</title><description>This is a single Celebrity Bunny. Players that have three or more Celebrity bunnies in The Bunny Circle may play two cards per turn.</description></topic><topic type=""><title>No Supe For You</title><description>No Supe For You may be used once by a player to roll the seven 12-sided dice (Violet, Orange, Green, Yellow, Blue, Red and Pink) and the Clear 20-sided die to eliminate all Super and Extra Super bunnies in The Bunny Circle that are the same color as any of the dice which rolled an Even number. An Even roll on the Clear 20-sided die eliminates Semi-Super bunnies. Good luck getting even!</description></topic><topic type=""><title> Hare E. Potter</title><description>Hare E. Potter may be used once by a player to take The Magic Spatula or any Magic Fountain card from the Discard Pile which may be used immediately or saved.</description></topic><topic type=""><title>Dago Bunny</title><description>Dago Bunny is a Green bunny that stops all weapons from directly targeting any Kinder bunnies owned by the same player in The Bunny Circle.</description></topic><topic type=""><title>Baby Bunnies On Board</title><description>The player that has this card saved, and at least one Kinder bunny in The Bunny Circle may roll both the 10-sided dice and the 12-sided dice of the same color any time that a card requests a die roll, and choose which number to use.</description></topic><topic type=""><title>Red Herring Pink Salmon</title><description>Red Herring Pink Salmon may be used once by a player to counteract the death of any one Red (or half Red) or Pink bunny in The Bunny Circle. May be used at any time!</description></topic><topic type=""><title>Bunnies Of The Caribbean</title><description>Bunnies Of The Caribbean may be used once by a player to steal an amount of Dolla equal to the roll of the Yellow 12-sided die from any opponent. Only the exact amount of Dolla may be taken. For example, if the player rolled a 9 on the Yellow 12-sided die and the only opponent with Dolla had only 5 Dolla, then the player could not take any Dolla from the opponent. The player would have to take the exact amount of Dolla from an opponent who had 9 or more Dolla.</description></topic><topic type=""><title>Spider Bunny</title><description>Spider Bunny may be used once by a player to eliminate either Carrot Thief, Pilfer The Pawn, Zodiac Thief, Pumpkin Ridge or Pinch Your Place. Or Spider Bunny may be used once to keep a player’s bunnies in place during a Shockwave. May be used at any time!

If Spider Bunny is used for a Psi card play (Non-Matching Colors), then a player may use the card immediately or save the card directly from his five-card hand.</description></topic><topic type=""><title>Bunny Eye For The Carrot Guy</title><description>Bunny Eye For The Carrot Guy may be used once by a player to roll the eight 12-sided dice (Violet, Orange, Green, Yellow, Blue, Black, Red and Pink) and to choose a Carrot from Kaballa’s Market (if the market is open) if he is the player wearing the most clothing with the color that matches the highest die rolled.

If two (or more) colors are tied for the highest die rolled, then give one Carrot to each player who is wearing the most clothing for each color. This may, of course, be the same player who would then take both Carrots. If the highest color rolled is not worn by any of the players, then no one takes a Carrot. Undergarments count as clothing!</description></topic><topic type=""><title>Shazbot</title><description>Shazbot may be given to any player. The player must return one Carrot to Kaballa’s Market (even if the market is closed) for each curse (or naughty) word that he speaks during the game. A player may pay 10 Dolla to remove this card.

A curse (or naughty) word can only be defined by the people playing the game. Since words change from group to group, country to country and language to language, it is impossible to provide a list of these words. Each group will have to decide for itself which words are not allowed. The word Shazbot is a safe word, and may therefore be used freely during play as a substitute for all curse (or naughty) words.</description></topic><topic type=""><title>After Darkness</title><description>After Darkness may be used once by a player to eliminate any level 50/50 weapon at any time after sunset or before sunrise. May be used at any time (during the game)! Players are encouraged to check official sunset and sunrise times for the location in which they are playing.

If After Darkness is used for a Psi card play (Non-Matching Colors), then a player may use the card immediately or save the card directly from his five-card hand.</description></topic><topic type=""><title>Pucker Up</title><description>Pucker Up may be used once by a player to force all opponents to roll a 12-sided die. The opponent who rolled the lowest number must either kiss the player or give him one saved Carrot, saved Zodiac card and saved Mysterious Place card if the opponent has at least one of each.

The opponent who rolled the lowest number on the 12-sided die may choose to kiss or not to kiss. If several opponents roll the same lowest numbers, then they must each choose whether to kiss the player, or to give him one saved Carrot, saved Zodiac card and saved Mysterious Place card.

Before the roll, the player must state exactly what kind of kiss he wants (and where). This will make it easier for all of the players in the game to decide whether or not the opponent’s kiss is ‘valid’.

If the opponent agrees to kiss and the player backs out, then the player must give the opponent two saved Carrots, saved Zodiac cards and saved Mysterious Place cards if the player has at least two of each.</description></topic><topic type=""><title>Hitchbunny’s Guide</title><description>Hitchbunny’s Guide may be used once by a player to roll the eight 12-sided dice (Violet, Orange, Green, Yellow, Blue, Black, Red and Pink) and five 10-sided dice (Violet, Orange, Green, Yellow and Blue – KinderBunnies®) and to take one card from the Discard Pile that features a picture of the planet Jupiter (either in full or partially) for each combination of a roll of 4 and 2 on the dice. Each of the 12-sided and 10-sided dice may only be combined once.

These Jupiter cards must be used immediately if they are Run cards, or they may be saved if they are Special or Very Special cards.</description></topic><topic type=""><title>Dr. Xavi-Hare</title><description>Dr. Xavi-Hare may be used once by a player to predict who will launch the next weapon and who will choose the next Carrot. If correct, the predicting player will control the target bunny for the weapon and take the Carrot for himself.

The predicting player must write down the name of the player who he believes will launch the next weapon. That player may be himself. A valid weapon launch must target a bunny. A weapon that is revealed and discarded does not count as a weapon launch. A weapon that is revealed and eliminated (perhaps by the Magic Spatula) before a bunny can be targeted does not count as a weapon launch.

In order for any player to launch a weapon, he must have a bunny in The Bunny Circle, reveal a Weapon card and announce a target. At this time, if the predicting player chose the correct player, then he may move the weapon from the target bunny to any other bunny. The predicting player may also discard the weapon if he wishes.

The predicting player must also write down the name of the player who he believes will choose the next Carrot from Kaballa’s Market. Again, that player may be himself. A valid Carrot choosing is any card that allows a player to choose from available Carrots at Kaballa’s Market (such as Choose A Carrot cards or Supplies Surprise). Cards such as Carrot Thief do not allow a player to choose which Carrot he will take and are not valid. The last Carrot taken (or purchased) from Kaballa’s Market is not valid either since the player had no choice. If the predicting player made the correct prediction, then he may take the Carrot for himself.

Keep in mind that if the predicting player himself is the first person to launch a weapon or to choose a Carrot, then no advantage is earned with this card.</description></topic><topic type=""><title>Meteor Rocks</title><description>Meteor Rocks may be placed under any Semi-Super, Super, or Extra Super Bunny in The Bunny Circle which loses all of its special features and becomes a regular bunny of the same color or classification.

The special features that Semi-Super, Super, or Extra Super bunnies may lose are:

1) Eliminating all other bunnies of the same color (or half color) or classification from The Bunny Circle.

2) Automatically playing two cards each turn.

3) Rolling the Clear 20-sided die for weapons with levels 1-12.

4) All Red and Pink special features.

A bunny that is abducted by the Beyea Aliens (Area 51 or Mothership) will have Meteor Rocks removed (discarded). If the bunny returns to The Bunny Circle, then it will have its special features again.</description></topic><topic type=""><title>Horton Hates A Who</title><description>Horton Hates A Who may be given to any player who must give an opponent one of his Carrots every time that he says the word, “Who”. Horton Hates A Who is discarded if or when the player has given each of his opponents one Carrot. The player may pay 10 Dolla to remove this card.</description></topic><topic type=""><title>Bunnies The Gathering</title><description>Bunnies The Gathering may be used once by a player to pat up to six bunnies in The Bunny Circle (one of each color – Violet, Red, Blue, Orange, Green and Yellow). To pat a bunny, simply turn the card 45 degrees counter-clockwise. The player must un-pat one bunny at the start of each of his turns until they are all back in position. Patted bunnies may not play Aggressive cards, but may be attacked and killed.</description></topic><topic type=""><title>Indiana Clones</title><description>Indiana Clones may be used once by a player to discard his entire five-card hand and replace it with any five Weapon cards from Rooney’s Weapons Emporium. Indiana Clones may not be used if Rooney’s Weapons Emporium is closed.</description></topic><topic type=""><title>Psi Corps</title><description>The player with this card saved may control all Psi cards used by any opponents. If the player denies the use of a Run Psi card to an opponent, then the opponent must discard it. If the player denies the use of a saved Special or Very Special Psi card to an opponent, then the opponent may keep the card and try again on his next turn.

If Psi Corps is used for a Psi card play (Non-Matching Colors), then a player may use the card immediately or save the card directly from his five-card hand if he has at least one bunny in The Bunny Circle.

If at any time the player has no bunnies in The Bunny Circle, then Psi Corps is discarded immediately. Players cannot save this Special without a bunny in The Bunny Circle.</description></topic><topic type=""><title>Atlas Shrugged</title><description>Atlas Shrugged may be used once to force all of the players to change their seats at the game table. Roll the eight 12-sided dice (Violet, Orange, Green, Yellow, Blue, Black, Red and Pink). If a number of dice (equal to the number of players) roll any identical number, then all players move to the adjacent seat. For example, if three people are playing, then Atlas Shrugged is activated if three of the numbers rolled are the same. It does not matter which number it is, as long as there are three of them.

All players leave their saved cards, and take possession of an opponent’s saved cards. Players keep their five-card hands. The player who played the card chooses the direction of movement for all of the players (either clockwise or counter-clockwise).</description></topic><topic type=""><title>Even Stephen Odd Todd</title><description>Even Stephen Odd Todd may be used once by a player to take a Carrot from either an opponent or Kaballa’s Market. An Even (or Odd) roll on the Yellow 12-sided die allows a player to take an Even (or Odd) numbered Carrot. For example, if a player rolls a 9 on the Yellow 12-sided die, then he may take any Odd numbered Carrot from either an opponent or Kaballa’s Market.

Carrots that are not numbered (like those in KinderBunnies®) may not be taken using Even Stephen Odd Todd.</description></topic><topic type=""><title>Journey To The Center Of The Circle</title><description>Journey To The Center Of The Circle may be used once to force all players to place their five-card hand into a separate pile in the center of The Bunny Circle. All of the cards are shuffled, and the player randomly deals five cards back to each player.</description></topic><topic type=""><title>Red October</title><description>Red October may be used once by a player to attempt to abduct bunnies from The Bunny Circle. Each player rolls the die once in the order of play. Players who roll an Odd number must place one of their bunnies from The Bunny Circle into the Red October while players who roll an Even number may take a bunny out. The player who played the card rolls last, and may roll twice.

If a player rolls an Even number, and no bunnies have been placed into the Red October, then he is out of luck. After the last player has rolled (and possibly re-rolled), any bunnies that are left in the Red October sink into the Discard Pile.</description></topic><topic type=""><title>Scarlet Letter</title><description>Scarlet Letter may be used once by a player to force any opponent to either discard all of the cards in his five-card hand that contain the letter “A” in the card title or that have a Red bullet in the upper left corner (Run cards). The player must decide which option to use before choosing an opponent.</description></topic><topic type=""><title> A Tale Of Two Bunnies</title><description>A Tale Of Two Bunnies may be given to any opponent with at least three bunnies in The Bunny Circle who must give any two of his bunnies away to other players. The opponent chooses which bunnies to give away and to which player.</description></topic><topic type=""><title>Through The Looking Glass</title><description>Through The Looking Glass may be used once by a player or given to any opponent to increase (Odd rolls), or decrease (Even rolls) their Cabbage or Water supplies by the amounts rolled.

For example, if a player rolls a 4 on the Green 12-sided die, and rolls a 7 on the Blue 12-sided die, then he will lose 4 Cabbage Units and gain 7 Water Units.

If a player gains Cabbage Units or Water Units by rolling an Odd number, then he must take them from the Discard Piles for those supplies. If the correct amounts of Cabbage Units and Water Units do not exist in the Discard Piles, then a player may either take Vouchers or keep track of what the game owes him. The player may take the supplies later when they become available in the Discard Piles.

If a player pays Cabbage Units and Water Units by rolling an Even number, then he must discard the amounts to the Discard Piles. If a player does not have enough (or any) of a supply, then he discards what he can. The player never owes the game any supplies after the card is played.</description></topic><topic type=""><title> Twenty-Three Skidoo</title><description>Twenty-Three Skidoo allows all players to discard any cards in their five-card hand that have a 2 or a 3 in the Card Identification Number. Players may keep any cards that they wish. All players must immediately draw new cards from the Draw Pile so that each has five cards in their hand.</description></topic><topic type=""><title>W Is For Whammy</title><description>W Is For Whammy may be used once by a player to launch all Weapon cards in his five-card hand at any bunnies in The Bunny Circle.

Weapons are launched one at a time directly from a player’s five-card hand. When the player has no more weapons in his five-card hand, he must immediately draw new cards from the Draw Pile until he has five cards in his hand again.</description></topic></topics></deck>
