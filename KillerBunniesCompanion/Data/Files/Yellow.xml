All of the rules for the Gorge The Bunny card are the same as the rules for the Feed The Bunny cards. The name was changed to emphasize the amounts of Cabbage Units and Water Units needed to feed (10 of each!). The Gorge The Bunny card should be considered a Feed The Bunny card, and may be eliminated using Sunny Day.</description></topic><topic type="run"><title>Sea Whiz Mount</title><description>Sea Whiz Mount may be placed on any bunny in The Bunny Circle which must roll higher than 10 on the Black 12-sided die to survive.

The highest bidder pays Kaballa (the Discard Pile) for the bunny. The player bids first, and bidding continues in the order of play.</description></topic><topic type="run"><title>Carrot Thief</title><description>Carrot Thief may be used once by a player to roll either the Orange 12-sided or Clear 20-sided die (Violet Booster Deck) and to steal the Carrot numbered the same as the roll from either Kaballa or any opponent. For example, if a player rolls a 6 on the Orange 12-sided die, then he may steal Carrot #6 (Butch) from the opponent who owns the Carrot, or from Kaballa’s Market (even if the market is closed)</description></topic><topic type="run"><title>Double No Trouble</title><description>Kaballa doubles your Dolla! Double No Trouble allows a player to take an amount of Dolla from the Discard Pile that is equal to the amount of Dolla that he has saved. For example, if a player has 5 Dolla when the card is played, then he will take another 5 Dolla from the Discard Pile. If the Discard Pile does not have the Dolla available, then the player may keep track of what the game owes him and take the Dolla from the Discard Pile when it becomes available. Players are not allowed to collect Dolla from any opponents to double while using the Double No Trouble card.</description></topic><topic type="run"><title>Rock Bottom</title><description>Rock Bottom may be used once by a player with no Cabbage Units or Water Units to take half the Cabbage Units and Water Units from the opponent with the most. If a player wishes to use Rock Bottom, then he must have no Cabbage Units to get Cabbage Units from an opponent, and no Water Units to get Water Units from an opponent. A player may get both supplies if he starts with no Cabbage Units and no Water Units.

The opponent with the greatest amount of Cabbage Units gives the player (who is using Rock Bottom) half of his Cabbage Units, and the opponent with the greatest amount of Water Units gives the player half of his Water Units. To find the total amount of Cabbage Units or Water Units, an opponent must add all of the units on all of his cards and Vouchers (Ominous Onyx Booster Deck).

If there is a tie and two or more opponents have the same number of Cabbage Units or Water Units, then the player may decide from which opponent he will take the supplies. If the opponent has an odd number of Cabbage Units or Water Units that cannot be divided equally, then he will keep the extra unit for himself.</description></topic><topic type="run"><title>Russian Roulette</title><description>To use Russian Roulette, all players with at least one bunny in The Bunny Circle must roll a 12-sided die. The lowest roller loses his bunny. The player who played Russian Roulette may re-roll the die if he does not like his first roll.

Each player gets to choose which of his bunnies will participate. If a player’s only bunny has The Heavenly Halo, then he may not participate since the bunny cannot be harmed.

If two players tie for the lowest roll, then both players must roll one of the dice again (and keep rolling) until the tie is broken.</description></topic><topic type="run"><title>Weil’s Freshness Center</title><description>Weil’s Freshness Center may be used once by a player to force any opponent to either pay 2 Dolla each (to the discard) to keep his Carrots fresh or to return them to Kaballa’s Market (even if the market is closed). An opponent may only have enough Dolla to keep some of his Carrots. For example, if the opponent had five Carrots but only 7 Dolla saved, then he could pay for three Carrots (a total of 6 Dolla) and would have to choose which two Carrots to return to Kaballa’s Market.</description></topic><topic type="special"><title>Bug Off</title><description>Bug Off may be used once by a player to eliminate the Roaches or to counteract the Maggots before losing all of his Cabbage Units. This card must be a saved Special to be used immediately. Remember, to save a Special card, a player must run it through the Bottom and Top Run card cycle.

Unlike Very Special cards, Bug Off may not be used to save other player’s bunnies from harm. This card is for the exclusive use of the player who has it saved.</description></topic><topic type="special"><title>Free Cabbage And Water</title><description>Free Cabbage And Water may be used once by a player to take one Cabbage Card and one Water Card from Kaballa’s Market. Free Cabbage And Water may not be used if Kaballa’s Market is closed.</description></topic><topic type="special"><title>The Minilith</title><description>The player with this card saved must double the range and level of each weapon he launches. Only weapon levels 1-9 are affected by The Minilith. Weapons affect the target bunny and adjacent bunnies.

Doubling the Weapon Level may make it nearly impossible for an opponent to survive a weapon. For example, if a player with The Minilith card saved plays the Flame Thrower ( Weapon Level 8 ) on a bunny in The Bunny Circle, then all three bunnies affected would need to roll higher than 16 on the Black 12-sided die to survive (which is not possible). It is, however, possible for any bunny to have enough Clovers underneath it to survive.

If at any time the player has no bunnies in The Bunny Circle, then The Minilith is discarded immediately.This is indicated by the Pink circle covering the Pink rectangular box.Players cannot save this Special without a bunny in The Bunny Circle.Remember, to save a Special card, a player must run it through the Bottom and Top Run card cycle.

A player may not choose which weapons will be affected.If a player has The Minilith saved, then all of the weapons levels 1-9 that he uses will be affected.A player may, however, discard The Minilith at any time during his turn.</description></topic><topic type="special"><title>Noah’s Flood</title><description>Noah’s Flood may be used once by a player to eliminate the Flame Thrower or to counteract the Drought before losing all of his Water Units.This card must be a saved Special to be used immediately.Remember, to save a Special card, a player must run it through the Bottom and Top Run card cycle.

Unlike Very Special cards, Noah’s Flood may not be used to save other player’s bunnies from harm.This card is for the exclusive use of the player who has it saved.</description></topic><topic type="special"><title>Rooney’s Weapons Exchange</title><description>Rooney’s Weapons Exchange may be used once by a player to forceany one opponent (or Rooney) to exchange any weapon of his for anyweapon of yours.The player must have at least one Weapon card inhis five-card hand to use this card.First, choose any opponent.If theopponent has any Weapon cards in his hand, then he must show themto the player.Next, the player may exchange any of his Weapon cardsfor any of the opponent’s Weapon cards.Of course if the opponent hadno Weapon cards in his five-card hand, then the player is out of luck and Rooney’s Weapons Exchange is discarded.
